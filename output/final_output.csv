"New raptor Rub-R-Cleat draper belt, 42"" x 198"" (16.5 ft.). The patent-pending Raptor technology is the first draper to use 100% polyester filament yarns rather than spun polyester fibers while using the benefits of both skim coating and friction coating rubber. The Raptor draper belt is made of filament fabric, immediately making it stronger and more durable. Pound for pound, a filament fabric WILL ALWAYS outperform a similar spun fabric with higher tensile, tear and puncture resistance. The Raptor draper belt features a friction coat on the underside of the belt and a skim coat on top. The result: Optimal Protection with Less Drag.

"New upper baler belting, 12"" x 486.5"" (40.54 ft.). Belting is 3 ply with texture top pattern and clipper fasteners. The baler belting is comprised of unique fabrics and compounds which provide excellent environmental resistance while withstanding highly abrasive conditions. Both are critical to reducing maintenance and costly downtime. The special textures used on the construction of the baler belting are vulcanized under heat and pressure to become an integral part of the finished belt. That is essential in order to withstand the extreme flexing which is common on large round balers. The standard two ply rubberized fabric, with a specially designed rectangular-angled lacing, is engineered for optimum tracking and excellent dimensional retention.

"New upper baler belting, 4"" x 484"" (40.3 ft.). Belting is 3 ply with texture top pattern and clipper fasteners. The baler belting is comprised of unique fabrics and compounds which provide excellent environmental resistance while withstanding highly abrasive conditions. Both are critical to reducing maintenance and costly downtime. The special textures used on the construction of the baler belting are vulcanized under heat and pressure to become an integral part of the finished belt. That is essential in order to withstand the extreme flexing which is common on large round balers. The standard two ply rubberized fabric, with a specially designed rectangular-angled lacing, is engineered for optimum tracking and excellent dimensional retention.

"New raptor Rub-R-Cleat self propelled swather belting, 42"" x 138"" (11.5 ft.). The patent-pending Raptor technology is the first draper to use 100% polyester filament yarns rather than spun polyester fibers while using the benefits of both skim coating and friction coating rubber. The Raptor draper belt is made of filament fabric, immediately making it stronger and more durable. Pound for pound, a filament fabric WILL ALWAYS outperform a similar spun fabric with higher tensile, tear and puncture resistance. The Raptor draper belt features a friction coat on the underside of the belt and a skim coat on top. The result: Optimal Protection with Less Drag.

"Bolt Pattern: 4 x 4""<br> NO COMPROMISE - The MICHELIN X TWEEL TURF airless radial tire has a consistent hub height which helps ensure the mower deck produces an even cut. The full-width poly-resin spokes provide excellent lateral stability for outstanding side hill performance, while the unique design of the spokes helps dampen the ride for enhanced operator comfort, even when navigating over curbs and other bumps. High performance compounds and an efficient contact patch are designed to provide a long wear life that is two to three times that of a pneumatic tire at equal tread depth.<br> NO DOWNTIME - The MICHELIN X TWEEL TURF product is designed to perform like a pneumatic tire, but without the risk and costly downtime associated with flat tires and unseated beads.<br> Mounted Diameter: 24""<br> Mounted Width: 12""<br> Rim Width: 12""<br> Wheel Offset: -0.75""<br> Maximum Load: 750 lbs.<br> Maximum Speed: 16 mph<br> Weight 22 kg.<br> Replaces: B185532TW4","https://www.aiproducts.com/images/B185532TW4(1).JPG","A-B150357TW4","24x12N12 X-TWEEL TURF - 4LUG","48.50 lbs","null"

"The MICHELIN X TWEEL TURF CASTER is also a single unit that replaces the tire/wheel/valve assembly. Get maximum performance for your machine by using TWEEL on both your rear and front tires. TWEEL CASTER is maintenance free, lasts longer than traditional tires and ensures an even cut and enhanced operator comfort.<br> The TWEEL CASTER is designed for optimal balance of mass and compression in order to provide the best cutting experience. Adding TWEEL drive and caster wheels enhances the performance of the mowers suspension providing for a softer ride.
